###Permute String
####Coding Exercise
Edwin Meyer

####Summary
Given an input alphabetic string of arbitrary length generate an array containing all possible string permutations produced by swapping the case of the individual alpha characters.

Each version can be coded in under ten lines. However the problem has some subtleties which require modest analytical thinking prior to coding.

permute_string.rb contains two solutions, one using recursion, the other iteration. It also contains a short test harness that exercises the two methods permute_string_recurse & permute_string_iterate. When presented as a coding test, the test harness can be be provided for testing the two solutions.
